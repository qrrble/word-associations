# word-associations
Exploring the word associations (i.e. given a cue word, think of a word you associate with it right away) data obtained from the Small World of Words Project using ML and NLP models.

Data is taken from the Small World of Words Project:
https://smallworldofwords.org/en/project/home

Installation notes:
- After downloading, unzip the files in the `data` directory.
- This project uses word2vec, so you'll need the `gensim` package.

Things to do:
- The SWOW project is also collecting word association data in other languages (ex. Dutch, the other currently available dataset), so it would be interesting to explore that too. For example, one could compare the word association similarities and differences across different languages.
